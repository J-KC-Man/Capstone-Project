Weather is an Android App that allows users to view and save worldwide weather information by text search or GPS location. 

## Technologies implemented

- Android Architecture Components: Room, Viewmodel and Livedata
- Butterknife library

## Usage

This app utilises OpenWeatherMap api. To obtain an api key, navigate to https://openweathermap.org/appid and sign up to generate a new key.

Once the key has been activated (normally takes ~1hr), replace the value of the "API_KEY" string field in global/Constants.java with the activated key
to begin using the api
